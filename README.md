# fingerprint-identification
using various machine learning methods to build a reliable fingerprint identification system from scratch

every part of the process is documented in the fingerprint_report.pdf file, while i have also made a compact presentation derived from it fingerprint_presentation.pdf

all the code you need to execute in order to test this is gathered in the final.ipynb notebook, dont skip cells!
